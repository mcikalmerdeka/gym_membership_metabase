METABASE PARAMETER TYPES REFERENCE
=====================================

There are 3 main ways to handle parameters/filters in Metabase:

1. QUESTION PARAMETERS ({{parameter}}) - Only work in individual questions
   - Syntax: WHERE condition = {{parameter_name}}
   - Example: WHERE gender = {{gender}}
   - Limitation: Filters disappear when added to dashboard
   - Use case: Standalone questions that need filtering

2. OPTIONAL PARAMETERS ([[AND...]]) - Only work in individual questions  
   - Syntax: WHERE 1=1 [[AND condition = {{parameter}}]]
   - Example: WHERE 1=1 [[AND gender = {{gender}}]]
   - Limitation: Also disappear when added to dashboard
   - Use case: Questions with optional filters

3. FIELD FILTERS ({{parameter}} as Field Filter type) - Work EVERYWHERE
   - Syntax: WHERE {{parameter_name}}
   - Example: WHERE {{gender}} AND {{abonoment_type}}
   - Setup: Parameter type = "Field Filter", map to database field
   - Advantage: Works in questions AND dashboards
   - Use case: Best for dashboard filtering

RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR DASHBOARDS:
===================================
Always use Field Filters (#3) when you want filtering to work on dashboards.

Example SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_members
FROM gym_members  
WHERE {{gender}} AND {{abonoment_type}} AND {{personal_training}};

Setup steps:
1. Add parameters in SQL editor
2. Set each parameter type to "Field Filter"  
3. Map each parameter to correct database field
4. When added to dashboard, these become dashboard filters automatically

DASHBOARD FILTERS vs QUESTION PARAMETERS:
=========================================
- Dashboard filters: Created at dashboard level, affect multiple charts
- Question parameters: Created at question level, only work in that question
- Field filters: Bridge both - work as question parameters AND become dashboard filters

Remember: If you want filtering on dashboards, use Field Filters!
